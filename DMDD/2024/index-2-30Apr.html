    <h2>About me</h2>

    <p>Some people call me by my latin name, Helianthus and others know me as sunflower, girassol, tournesol,... Although I mostly have yellow flowers, I occasionally 'blush' in rusty red, green and white bursts of flowering patterns.
    </p>

    <p>
       Mostly, I need sun. I'm at my best shape when my soil is fertile and when I'm in a sheltered spot, but I also thrive if I'm placed in a container. When on the ground, I grow really tall!

        I have throughout my live inspired many artists, whith the most famous one being Van Gogh. <a href="http://agnesdenesstudio.com/">Agnes Dennes</a> once planted a field of golden wheat in Manhattan and I wished I'd been there too, but it was in 1982 when I wasn't born yet and only my wheat friends made it to the plot of land.
